            <p>At the age of 5, Angel appeared in the 2008 film Jolene. Angel started his career by appearing in numerous theater productions.[6] At the age of 7, Desert Stages Theatre held auditions for the musical Oliver! and, with his parents' permission, Angel auditioned and won a role in the production.[7] His mother promised to take him to Los Angeles if he "put in the work and [did] 30 [local] shows", and he went on to act in multiple plays including The Little Mermaid, Seussical, Mary Poppins, and Into the Woods at the Desert Stages Theatre in Scottsdale. His mother kept her promise, and Angel traveled to Los Angeles where, at age 12, he auditioned for and won the part of Jonah Beck in the Disney Channel television series Andi Mack. His whole family moved to Utah to accommodate filming for the series.[4]

                In April 2019, Angel played the lead role of Billy Batson, with Zachary Levi starring as his adult superhero alter ego, in the film adaptation of DC Comics' Shazam!. The film, a further installment of the DC Extended Universe, was released to critical acclaim.[8] Angel released his debut single "One Thought Away", featuring Wiz Khalifa, on June 6, 2019.[9] </p>
